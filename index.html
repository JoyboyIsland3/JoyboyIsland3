            <p>I don't want or care about impressing someone, My will stands before me and it's unbreakable.</p>
            <p>A real pirate needs a strong resolve and will to accomplish anything.</p>
            <p>Stop thinking and worrying and just go.</p>
            <p>To me, music is not just a pastime, It's my passion and a big part of what makes me FREE.</p>
            <p>I'm far from a hero, never wanted to be one.</p>
            <p>Listen to this music and feel what it's like to be FREE.</p>
