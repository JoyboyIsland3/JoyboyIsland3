## I want to start off by saying, 

# I JUST WANT TO BE FREE.

### I don't want or care about impressing someone, My will stands before me and it's unbreakable.

### A real pirate needs a strong resolve and will to accomplish anything.

## Stop thinking and worrying and just go. 

# To me, music is not just a pastime, It's my passion and a big part of what makes me FREE.

I'm far from a hero, never wanted to be one.

Listen to this music and feel what it's like to be # FREE.

# MORE THOUGHTS

## " I do without expecting anything back, I’m no debt collector but a pirate "

## " When you’re dead all that’s left is bones " 

## " Christ heart, pirate body "

## " Wager on me go all in "

## " I defy destiny and make my own way "

## " I don’t lose anything if I’m free, it’s just one less chain on me " 

# I'll be updating this page often. Don't think this is it. We just started :)
